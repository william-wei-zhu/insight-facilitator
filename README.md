# Insight Facilitator

Insight Facilitator generates profound insights and thought-provoking discussion questions for any book or movie. Powered by OpenAI GPT-4o, it uses a streamlined system of autonomous AI agents to deliver a focused analysis tailored to the specific media type.

## How It Works

Insight Facilitator uses three specialized AI agents working in sequence:

1. **Information Gatherer**: Researches the book or movie, finding plot details, themes, character information, and critical reception

2. **Insight Analyst**: Analyzes the research to generate insights about themes, character development, artistic techniques, and deeper meanings

3. **Discussion Facilitator**: Creates thought-provoking discussion questions perfect for book clubs, film discussions, or personal reflection

## Features

- **Deep Analysis**: Goes beyond surface-level summaries to provide meaningful insights
- **Discussion Ready**: Creates questions that spark engaging conversations
- **OpenAI Powered**: Utilizes GPT-4o for comprehensive analysis
- **Streamlined Interface**: Clean design with focused input areas

## Usage

1. Enter any book or movie title
2. Select the media type (Book or Movie)
3. Click "Generate Insights & Discussion Questions"
4. Receive insights and discussion questions

**Note**: Analysis takes 2-3 minutes to complete.
