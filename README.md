# Insight Facilitator

Insight Facilitator generates profound insights and thought-provoking discussion questions for any book or movie. Powered by OpenAI GPT-4o with AWS Bedrock as a backup option, it uses a system of autonomous AI agents working together to deliver a comprehensive analysis.

## How It Works

Insight Facilitator uses three specialized AI agents working in sequence:

1. **Information Gatherer**: Researches the book or movie, finding plot details, themes, character information, and critical reception

2. **Insight Analyst**: Analyzes the research to generate 8 profound insights about themes, character development, artistic techniques, and deeper meanings

3. **Discussion Facilitator**: Creates 8 thought-provoking discussion questions perfect for book clubs, film discussions, or personal reflection

## Features

- **Deep Analysis**: Goes beyond surface-level summaries to provide meaningful insights
- **Discussion Ready**: Creates questions that spark engaging conversations
- **Flexible Engine**: Choose between OpenAI GPT-4o (recommended) or AWS Bedrock Claude 3 Haiku
- **Minimalist Interface**: Apple-inspired clean design with elegant typography and focused input areas

## Usage

1. Enter any book or movie title
2. Select the media type (Book or Movie)
3. Click "Generate Insights & Discussion Questions"
4. Receive 8 profound insights and 8 thought-provoking discussion questions

**Note**: Analysis takes 2-3 minutes to complete.
